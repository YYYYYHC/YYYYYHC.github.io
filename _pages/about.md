I am a Second-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr. [Changjian Li](https://enigma-li.github.io). Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree at Xian, China, where I met Dr. [Jiaqi Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/jiaqiyang) and started my research journey. I have a specific research interest in **user-friendly 3D design**, a cross-field of Computer Graphics, Computer Vision and Human-Computer Interaction.
