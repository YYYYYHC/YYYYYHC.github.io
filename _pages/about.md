I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr. [Changjian Li](https://enigma-li.github.io). Before that, I got my Bachelor degree at Xian, China, where I met Dr. [Jiaqi Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/jiaqiyang) and strated my research journey. My research interest covers a wide range of Computer Graphics, 3D Vision, and Robotics. Currently, I am focusing on parametric shape modeling, and my goal is to enable user-friendly 3D interfacing for 3D content.

Besides research, I love writing (in Chinese), badminton, jogging and cooking. Feel free to contact me for any of our common interests.
